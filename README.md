## ✨ Features  

### 🖥️ Local Quests  
- Daily/weekly tasks to clean up your system.  
- Progress bars + streak rewards.  

### 🤖 Smart Auto-Sorting  
- Uses **ML models (TensorFlow/PyTorch)** to suggest file categories.  
- Detects duplicates & clutter automatically.  

### 🎖️ Rewards System  
- XP, badges, and achievements (e.g., *Duplicate Destroyer*).  
- Leaderboard for the tidiest desktops.  

### 🌐 Community Challenges *(optional)*  
- Share anonymized metadata tasks with others.  
- Help train better ML classifiers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Electron + React (cross-platform UI)  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask for API, file system logic)  
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow / PyTorch (file classification, duplicate detection)  
- **Database**: SQLite (local), Postgres/Firebase (cloud sync + community)
